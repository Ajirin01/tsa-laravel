However, advanced pupils from the RB centres move directly to the “Learning to Read” Programme. The Learning-to-Read (LR) programme is meant for children who score 80% or above on the Pre-School Basic Readiness Test. It is also called the A B Cs with Ace and Christi Programme. The LR Programme is a phonetic skills package that dovetails into the School of Tomorrow PACE curriculum. The Programme utilizes a number of outstanding reading tools- a specially developed alphabet sequence, songs for each of the sounds, poems, displays, and physical activities. Additionally, there are character development activities and Bible stories built into the programme. The programme is designed to be used in conjunction with Word Building PACEs 1001-1012 and Maths PACEs 1001-1012. The LR programme takes about 12 to 15 weeks.</p><br>
