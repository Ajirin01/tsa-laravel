                <p > Trumpet Sound Academy (TSA) uses mainly the Accelerated Christian Education (ACE) School of Tomorrow curriculum and inculcates the Nigerian curriculum to bridge all gap topics and subjects. This makes the school unique, as its approach is not conventional.  It places emphasis on learning rather than teaching and a great deal is done to recognize and motivate individual pupils. Very close co-operation with parents is encouraged and expected, hence, much responsibility for the training and education of children is placed on the School as well as with the parents</p><br>

Normally, a student will complete a minimum of 72 PACEs in one academic year, however, this varies according to the student’s ability. The core curriculum at the individualized learning level includes the six basic academic disciplines that provide a student’s essential educational needs: Mathematics, English, Science, Social Studies, World Building, Literature and Creative Writing. Other Gap topics and subjects (as well as remedial courses) and expanded curriculum (Bible Reading, Animal Science, Nigerian Gap subjects) are included in training the pupils as the need arises. The average and brighter students who are able to complete the core curriculum quickly and need an extra challenge (from grade 2 to 8) are administered the TSA Expanded Curriculum.</p><br>

                                <p>The reading programmes trains the child to read. The Reading Readiness (RR) Programme also known as the Pre-School with Ace and Christi is a full year programme designed to develop the basic skills which prepare a child to be ready to “Learn to Read”. Cartoon animal songs and stories, 60 PACEs, Physical Development Activities,  and Bible and character-building stories are employed to foster learning of the letter sounds; to encourage understanding of number concepts and word relationships; to strengthen memory, visual, auditory, and coordination skills; and to build Biblical Character Traits. However, advanced pupils from the RB centres move directly to the “Learning to Read” Programme. The Learning-to-Read (LR) programme is meant for children who score 80% or above on the Pre-School Basic Readiness Test. It is also called the A B Cs with Ace and Christi Programme. The LR Programme is a phonetic skills package that dovetails into the School of Tomorrow PACE curriculum. The Programme utilizes a number of outstanding reading tools- a specially developed alphabet sequence, songs for each of the sounds, poems, displays, and physical activities. Additionally, there are character development activities and Bible stories built into the programme. The programme is designed to be used in conjunction with Word Building PACEs 1001-1012 and Maths PACEs 1001-1012. The LR programme takes about 12 to 15 weeks.</p><br>

                                <p>Each student is assigned a curriculum according to guidelines. The Core Curriculum consists of Mathematics (including Quantitative Reasoning), English Studies (including Verbal Reasoning, Phonetics and all other aspects of English), Social Studies, Science, Word Building, Literature and Creative Writing. Others include computer studies, French (and other languages), Civic, Physical and Health Education. In the first six levels of core curriculum, the student is introduced to God and His creation.  Through this frame of reference, many facts about the world and the universe are presented.  Science teaches about God’s physical creation, Social Studies present the world as ruled and ordered by God and History as “His Story”.  Mathematics presents facts about God’s orderly world.  English teaches the student the importance of communication in living for God.  Word Building, Literature and Creative Writing reinforce communication skills and provide practice for improved vocabulary and word usage. All PACEs/workbooks have been harmoniously developed to give the student academic balance that enable a learner from TSA a ready instrument to perfectly fit into any further studies anywhere in the world. The training also reveal to the learners God’s point of view concerning Himself, the Student, and the World.  Such orientation is essential in training children to be accountable to the living God.</p><br>

Thereafter learning is achieved at the pace of the learner; however, with strong motivation by the supervisor</p><br>
            <span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00"> Goal and Control</span>
            <p>Goal setting is basic to student’s success.  Students are trained and allowed to set reasonable learning goals that can be achieved in a prescribed period of time.  It gives pupils the responsibility for learning by ensuring they learn to plan their work and set achievable daily goals.  Students are trained to see daily assignments
                as steps necessary to maintain continuous progress, which is part of a life-training process.  However, the emphasis is on how much a student can accomplish each day and not so much he can accomplish each year.</p><br>
            <span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00">Prescribed Curriculum</span>
            <p>Each student is assigned a curriculum according to guidelines. The Core Curriculum consists of Mathematics (including Quantitative Reasoning), English Studies (including Verbal Reasoning, Phonetics and all other aspects of English), Social Studies, Science, Word Building, Literature and Creative Writing. Others include computer studies, French (and other languages), Civic, Physical and Health Education. In the first six levels of core curriculum, the student is introduced to God and His creation.  Through this frame of reference, many facts about the world and the universe are presented.  Science teaches about God’s physical creation, Social Studies present the world as ruled and ordered by God and History as “His Story”.  Mathematics presents facts about God’s orderly world.  English teaches the student the importance of communication in living for God.  Word Building, Literature and Creative Writing reinforce communication skills and provide practice for improved vocabulary and word usage. All PACEs/workbooks have been harmoniously developed to give the student academic balance that enable a learner from TSA a ready instrument to perfectly fit into any further studies anywhere in the world. The training also reveal to the learners God’s point of view concerning Himself, the Student, and the World.  Such orientation is essential in training children to be accountable to the living God.</p><br>

Cartoon animal songs and stories, 60 PACEs, Physical Development Activities,  and Bible and character-building stories are employed to foster learning of the letter sounds; to encourage understanding of number concepts and word relationships; to strengthen memory, visual, auditory, and coordination skills; and to build Biblical Character Traits. However, advanced pupils from the RB centres move directly to the “Learning to Read” Programme. The Learning-to-Read (LR) programme is meant for children who score 80% or above on the Pre-School Basic Readiness Test. It is also called the A B Cs with Ace and Christi Programme. The LR Programme is a phonetic skills package that dovetails into the School of Tomorrow PACE curriculum. The Programme utilizes a number of outstanding reading tools- a specially developed alphabet sequence, songs for each of the sounds, poems, displays, and physical activities. Additionally, there are character development activities and Bible stories built into the programme. The programme is designed to be used in conjunction with Word Building PACEs 1001-1012 and Maths PACEs 1001-1012. The LR programme takes about 12 to 15 weeks.</p><br>
